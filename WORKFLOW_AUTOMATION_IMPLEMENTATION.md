## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Workflow Architecture
```typescript
// Workflow Structure
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  triggerType: "time" | "event" | "api" | "manual";
  triggerConfig: string; // JSON configuration
  actions: string; // JSON array of actions
  isActive: boolean;
  executions: WorkflowExecution[];
}
```

### Action Execution Engine
```typescript
// Action Processing
async function executeAction(action: any, triggerData: any): Promise<any> {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "send_email":
      return await executeSendEmail(action.config, triggerData);
    case "create_task":
      return await executeCreateTask(action.config, triggerData);
    case "send_message":
      return await executeSendMessage(action.config, triggerData);
    // ... more action types
  }
}
```

### Visual Builder Implementation
```typescript
// Drag-and-Drop Workflow Builder
const handleDragStart = (e: React.DragEvent, stepId: string) => {
  setDraggingStep(stepId);
  e.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain", stepId);
};

const handleDrop = (e: React.DragEvent) => {
  const rect = e.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect();
  const x = e.clientX - rect.left;
  const y = e.clientY - rect.top;
  
  updateStep(draggingStep, {
    position: { x, y }
  });
};
```

### Execution Monitoring
```typescript
// Real-time Execution Tracking
const execution = await db.workflowExecution.create({
  data: {
    workflowId: params.id,
    userId: session.user.id,
    triggerData: triggerData ? JSON.stringify(triggerData) : null,
    status: "running",
  },
});

// Execute asynchronously
executeWorkflowAsync(params.id, execution.id, triggerData);
```
