## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Project Architecture
```typescript
// Project Management Structure
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  status: "active" | "completed" | "cancelled" | "on_hold";
  priority: "low" | "medium" | "high" | "urgent";
  startDate?: Date;
  endDate?: Date;
  budget?: number;
  managerId?: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  members: ProjectMember[];
  milestones: ProjectMilestone[];
  resources: ProjectResource[];
  tasks: Task[];
}
```

### Kanban Board Implementation
```typescript
// Column-based Task Management
const columns = [
  { id: "todo", title: "To Do", color: "bg-gray-100" },
  { id: "in_progress", title: "In Progress", color: "bg-blue-100" },
  { id: "in_review", title: "In Review", color: "bg-yellow-100" },
  { id: "done", title: "Done", color: "bg-green-100" },
];
```

### Gantt Chart Timeline
```typescript
// Dynamic Timeline Generation
const generateTimeline = () => {
  const { start, end } = getTimelineDates();
  const timeline = [];
  const current = new Date(start);

  while (current <= end) {
    timeline.push(new Date(current));
    
    if (viewMode === "days") {
      current.setDate(current.getDate() + 1);
    } else if (viewMode === "weeks") {
      current.setDate(current.getDate() + 7);
    } else {
      current.setMonth(current.getMonth() + 1);
    }
  }

  return timeline;
};
```

### Resource Management
```typescript
// Resource Type Handling
const getResourceTypeIcon = (type: string) => {
  switch (type) {
    case "human": return <Users className="h-4 w-4" />;
    case "equipment": return <Settings className="h-4 w-4" />;
    case "material": return <Package className="h-4 w-4" />;
    default: return <Package className="h-4 w-4" />;
  }
};
```
